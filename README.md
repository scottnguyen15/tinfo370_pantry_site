Scott:
- Made and uploaded the .html files for the login, home, and check-in pages. (I was grinding for the Nayak exam sorry y'all ðŸ˜­)

Scott:
- Added font integration for Encode Sans and Open Sans using Google Fonts' embed feature.
- Added a hover color for the buttons on the index (home) page.
- Fixed an error where clicking 'Asian' in the check-in form would send the page up. This error came from a mislabeling of the 'id=asian', where I had accidentally left it as 'id=yes'.
