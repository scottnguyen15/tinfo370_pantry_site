Scott:
- Made and uploaded the .html files for the login, home, and check-in pages. (I was grinding for the Nayak exam sorry y'all ðŸ˜­)

5/1/2024

Scott:
- Added font integration for Encode Sans and Open Sans using Google Fonts' embed feature.
- Added a hover color for the buttons on the index (home) page.
- Fixed an error where clicking 'Asian' in the check-in form would send the page up. This error came from a mislabeling of the 'id=asian', where I had accidentally left it as 'id=yes'.
- Added the folders for css, js, and imgs to the GitHub repo.
- Updated the footer date from 4/25/2024 to 5/1/2024.

5/6/2024

Scott:
- Coded a method for the check-in page that hides the survey sections until the user has chosen 'yes' or 'no'. This was accomplished through making div sections for returning users and new users, then handling the visibility in the css.
- Created the pages for check-out and order-in. Every form has now been imported to the website interface!
